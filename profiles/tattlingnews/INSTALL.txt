MANAGING NEWS INSTALLATION GUIDE


REQUIREMENTS

Managing News has been tested successfully with the following system:

1 Apache (with mod_rewrite for clean urls)

2 MySQL 5

3 PHP 5.2 (32M memory limit / 30+ second max execution time)
  To increase your PHP memory limit see http://drupal.org/node/207036

Your mileage may vary with other configurations. See TUNING below.

If you are upgrading an existing Managing News site please refer to UPGRADE.txt.


INSTALLATION

Assumes that you have downloaded Managing News from http://www.managingnews.com.
This means that all required modules, themes and features are present.

1 Follow installation instructions in Drupal's INSTALL.txt, when prompted for
  installation profile, pick "Managing News"

2 Make sure that you have set up your files directory with the proper permissions
  http://drupal.org/node/394704

3 Make sure to configure cron http://drupal.org/cron . Recommended update
  frequency: 3 minutes.


PACKAGING WITH DRUSH MAKE

If you have not downloaded the full Managing News package from
http://managingnews.com you can use drush to download all required modules,
themes and features.

Assumes basic knowledge of how to install and use drush commands.

1 Install drush (if not yet present) and drush_make
  http://drupal.org/project/drush
  http://drupal.org/project/drush_make
  Use patch http://drupal.org/files/issues/911568-1_drupalcode.patch

2 Check out Managing News from Drupal CVS

3 Change into Managing News directory and run rebuild.sh

  Select "Build a full Managing News distribution".

4 Copy and unpack the resulting zip file to your web directory.


PACKAGING WITH DRUSH MAKE FOR DEVELOPMENT

1 Install drush (if not yet present) and drush_make (see above)

2 Get latest Drupal from drupal.org

3 Change into Drupal's profile directory and check out Managing News from
  Drupal CVS

4 Change into Managing News directory and run rebuild.sh

  Select "Rebuild Managing News in place".

  NOTE: The make file in the Managing News - managingnews.make - may not contain
  pointers to VCS repositories but releases. So setting Managing News up for
  development may involve changing the managingnews.make file so that the
  modules that you would like to modify are checked out from the repository
  instead of downloaded as a release.


SETUP TASKS

Once you have installed Managing News, there are several tasks you may want
to do to setup and configure your site.

- Add your first RSS/Atom feed. Many popular websites have a link titled "RSS"
  with further options for choosing the type of items you would like to
  subscribe to.

- Customize your site's name and mission text. Go to "Admin > Site information."

- Customize your site's theme. You can upload a custom logo, print logo,
  background image, and change your site's colors. Go to "Admin > Theme settings"
  to make these changes.

- Add other users to your site. Once you've added other users they can create
  new feeds, save searches, and organize stories into channels.

- Import RSS/Atom feeds from other sites: Go to "Admin > Import OPML" and upload
  your subscription export file from Google Reader, Bloglines or any other
  service that exports feed subscriptions in OPML format.


TUNING

Per default Managing News is configured to update 5 feeds per cron run. This
number is low to ensure robust behavior on cron time even on slower servers.

With this setting, a cron run should not exceed ~ 32MB of memory usage and ~ 30
seconds of execution time.

As soon as your Managing News is subscribed to more than 30 feeds, this setting
may not show the desired performance.

If you would like to improve the overall update frequency on feeds, follow these
steps:

1. Allow Managing News to use more memory, set the memory limit to e. g. 128 or
   256 M

2. Use drush http://drupal.org/project/drush for running cron. This eliminates
   the PHP execution time limit and uses less memory.

   myserver# drush cron

3. Now you can up the number of feeds that are being processed per cron run:

   // In your settings.php file.
   // Set number of feeds to update per cron run, maximum number depending on
   // the configuration in 1 and the time between cron runs.
   $conf['feeds_schedule_num'] = 20;

4. Go to admin/reports/dblog and observe the messages by "MN Core": Make sure
   that "Page execution time" is within the period between cron runs and "Peak
   memory usage" does not exceed the setting defind in step 1.

As a general rule, more often and short cron runs are better. Tuning for around
20 feeds per update seems to be a good compromise. Keep in mind, that the exact
numbers are going to depend a lot on the kinds of feeds your Managing News is
aggregating: are they slow to fetch? Do they have may items? Do items on these
feeds have large text bodies?
